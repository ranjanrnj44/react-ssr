      <p>
        In the context of React.js, concurrency refers to having more than one
        task in progress at once, and concurrent tasks can overlap depending on
        which is more urgent. For example, while I write this post, I am
        preparing Jollof rice a Nigerian delicacy. When the time comes to add
        ingredients to the meal, that will be more urgent, so I/’ll pause
        writing and attend to that and come back to continue writing when I/’m
        done. Meanwhile, my food will still be cooking. At different points
        throughout the writing and cooking processes, my focus will be on what
        is more urgent.
